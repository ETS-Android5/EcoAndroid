    This inspection identifies cases where a simple cache mechanism can be added in the method onReceive of subclasses of android.content.BroadcastReceiver. In those cases, the source code is refactored so that changes in the
    values retrieved from the intent parameter are checked before processing the information received.<br>

    <b>Note</b>: This application does not change the information provided through Logs.
